## Phaser Demo

This is a demonstration of how to make a simple platformer using Phaser (phaser.io)

## Controls

The controls are A = Left, D = Right, and Space = Jump. My arrow keys are busted so I typically use WASD and the standard controls in my games.

## About

To learn how to use Phaser better, I followed along with multiple tutorials showing demonstrations on how to do simple movement, collision, and how to use sprite sheets with Phaser. After running into many different problems especially using ES6 syntax I managed to get basic controls down, but no end goal or objective.
